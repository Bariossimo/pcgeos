DESCRIPTION:
	This file contains the PC/GEOS implementations of the C routines
	malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), cfree(), and free().

NOTES:
	There are 2 allocation strategies used by this code. If the block size
	is below MALLOC_LARGE_THRESHOLD, then it is allocated in one of the
	fixed LMem heaps kept for this purpose. If the block size is above
	the threshold, then the memory is allocated in a global memory block
	by itself. Since the pointer to memory returned by the "large" strategy
	is below any of the valid pointers returned by the "small" strategy 
	(due to the fact that the small blocks all lie beyond the 
	LMemBlockHeader at the start of the lmem blocks, while the large 
	blocks all lie at LARGE_BLOCK_OFFSET, which is less than the
	LMemBlockHeader), we are able to tell which type of block it is just
	by looking at the address.

	When we free these blocks, we have a different strategy for each.
	When we free a large block, we just call MemFree on the block. If 
	it is a small block, we free the chunk, and then check to see if that
	LMem block is now empty. If it isn't, we just exit. If it is, we scan
	through the list of lmem blocks to see if it is the only lmem block.
	if it isn't, we free it up (so we have at most one empty lmem block
	hanging around per geode).

	In the GeodePrivData for each geode we keep 2 words - the first one
	is the handle of a block containing a list of handles of lmem blocks
	used for the small allocation scheme. The second one is the handle
	of a block containing a list of handles of global memory blocks 
	containing blocks allocated via the large allocation scheme.
	The format of these blocks is as follows:

		word	numberOfEntriesInList	;This includes any empty slots
		word	entry1
		word	entry2
		word	entry3
